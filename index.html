                <p>Today, more and more people understand that neural networks are the future, and that they can do
                    things that were previously impossible. <br><br> Like any innovative product, neural networks
                    seem to a wide
                    audience as something of little use, but interesting. <br><br> They know how to write music,
                    process and
                    generate images, highlight the main points, voice text, and maintain a simple dialogue. <br> But
                    after
                    the first delight, everyone will play enough, and the new product will become commonplace in all
                    areas.</p>

            <div class="flex">
                <p>The world has created neural networks that can draw pictures in any existing artistic style,
                    confidently beat the world champion in the most complex logic game on the planet, record music
                    albums and imitate human behavior in electronic correspondence. All of the above is so far only
                    a
                    demonstration of some of the capabilities of the technology, the real application of which both
                    in
                    business and in everyday life, we will see in the near future.
                    <br><br>
                    In other words, neural networks will make it possible not only and not so much to replace human
                    labor in more complex work activities, but to become a useful tool for specialists and managers
                    in
                    many fields.
